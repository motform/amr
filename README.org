* The Parliament of Species 
The Parliament of Species is a gamified citizen tool that aims to create an archive of possible policies based on scientific projections about the future of AMR. It enables citizens to co-create policies by building upon each other’s speculations, reflections and knowledge.

This is a student project form the course Design and Social Innovation, a part of the Interaction Design Masters Programme at Malmö University.

* Notes
This repository contains all the code for the application, but lacks a few key things due to licensing:
  - Fonts 
  - Datomic installation configuration 
  - Image assets
  - Base data to seed Projections and Policies

If you want to run the application yourself, you have to supply at least a Datomic instance and some base Projections. The format of these are specified in the config and config namespaces, as well as in the Datomic schema.
