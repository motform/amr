The Parliament of Species is a gamified citizen tool that aims to create an archive of possible policies based on scientific projections about the future of AMR. It enables citizens to co-create policies by building upon each other’s speculations, reflections and knowledge.

This is a student project form the course Design and Social Innovation, a part of the Interaction Design Masters Programme at Malmö University.
